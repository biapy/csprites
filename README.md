cSprites - Dynamic PHP CSS sprites
==================================

cSprites is a pure PHP driven CSS sprite generator. It uses the GD library to automatically combine your images into larger sprites to cut down on http requests. In addition it automatically generates all the CSS you need to use the sprites.

This is a fork from unmaintaned sourceforge project : [cSprites(http://csprites.sourceforge.net/)](http://csprites.sourceforge.net/).

The main goal is to fix some bugs. Feel free to fork and contribute.
